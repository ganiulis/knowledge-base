# Summary

Unit tests have several uses:

1. Test naming and procedures act as documentation.
2. Ensure inputs/outputs are predicted.
3. Change the approach to writing new code: slower, more intentional.
4. Ensure backwards-compatibility when refactoring or modifying existing code.

The test itself does not provide the value. The value comes from the mindset
shift of the developer as they write the unit test.
