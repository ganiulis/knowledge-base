Drugs are chemicals which alter physiological or biochemical processes in the body for the purposes of treating, preventing, or curing diseases.

Drugs may also harm the body when used inappropriately.

Inputs:

1. Dose of drug
2. Frequency of administration
3. Route of administration

These inputs vary based on the unique characteristics and varying conditions of the recipient.

Two steps in drug input and response:

1. Pharmacokinetics encompass the events between the administration of the drug and the distribution of the drug in the body
2. Pharmacodynamics encompass the arrival of the drug at its site of activation and the response of the body

Injection techniques:

1. Intravenous—in the vein at 25 degrees
2. Intradermal—in the skin at 15 degrees
3. Subcutaneous—in fat at 45 degrees
4. Intramuscular—in the muscle at 90 degrees (perpendicular)
