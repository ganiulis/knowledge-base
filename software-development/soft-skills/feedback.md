Collecting feedback is a pretty good idea.

Feedback is an opportunity to become a better team member and software developer by asking the right questions.

# Instructions

1. Create a small feedback form. The simpler the the better. [Google Forms](https://www.google.com/forms/about/) is a common choice.
2. Add four open-ended prompts to the form:
   1. What should I stop doing?\*
   2. What should I start doing?\*
   3. What should I keep doing?\*
   4. Additional feedback and notes
3. Require the first three prompts. Only the fourth prompt is optional.
4. Send the form to peers you work with daily and wait a week.
5. Check the responses once the week has passed.
6. Note down whatever responses you find actionable and make action points for yourself with a deadline of a few months.
7. Send the form to the same peers again once these action points have been fulfilled. The same one can do.
8. Wait another week.
9. Compare old responses with new ones and self-evalute whether you've made positive progress. Course-correct if not.

# Notes

1. I prefer to keep forms anonymous; otherwise I ask my peers for feedback directly without a form. Either way those colleagues who want to be recognized will find a way to make it clear who they are.
2. Optional feedback tends to net less responses overall, but these responses are more honest.
3. Frequent feedback is great, but tiring for the team. On the other hand infrequent feedback isn't optimal for personal growth. I space out feedback requests by 2 - 3 months.
