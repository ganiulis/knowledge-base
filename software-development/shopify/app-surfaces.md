# App surfaces

App surfaces are where [Apps](https://apps.shopify.com/) can embed themselves.

Shopify's data models can be extended with _metafields_ and _metaobjects_.

_Metafields_ add new fields on default resources such as orders or products.

_Metaobjects_ are data structures that store custom App information.

See <https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/app-surfaces#custom-data>.
