# App Bridge

The [App Bridge](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-bridge) provides the developer with the tools to create a pre-themed, rendered homepage of their App called an [app surface](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/app-surfaces) where the merchant can configure the App.

App surface components don't render as part of the app's component hierarchy. They are React-like wrappers around JavaScript messages that communicate with the Shopify admin. The Shopify admin renders the UI.
