# Hypertext Transfer Protocol

HTTPS is HTTP with encryption and verification.

HTTPS uses SSL/TLS to encrypt HTTP requests and responses between the client and server.

Popular tools such as [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org) and [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) can encrypt and verify HTTP requests and responses.

There are two keys—a public key and a private key—and the public key is shared with client device via the SSL certificate of the server. Once a client connects to the server, both devices use the public and private key to agree on new keys (session keys) to encrypt any further communications between them.

Possession of the private key by the server that matches the public key of a website's SSL certificate proves that the server is the legitimate host for the website.

See <https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/why-is-http-not-secure/> to read more about the process.

Encryption works like this:

1. The client establishes a secure connection with a TLS handshake
2. The server responds with its SSL/TLS configuration as well as digital certificate by a trusted certificate authority such as [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org)
3. The client verifies the certificate (validity and expiration date)
4. A shared session key is generated by the client and server
5. Two messages are sent from the client and the server to confirm the session key encrypts correctly
6. All further requests and responses are encrypted using the session key
7. The session key is invalidated when the connection is severed after the client or the server closes the active connection

Example HTTP `GET` request:

```http
GET /hello.txt HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: curl/7.63.0 libcurl/7.63.0 OpenSSL/1.1.l zlib/1.2.11
Host: www.example.com
Accept-Language: en
```

Example HTTPS `GET` request:
