## Hash Table

A hash function (or: hashing alhorithm) is a calculation applied to a key to
transform it into an address. There's several available methods.

A common issue is open addressing, which can overwrite an already existing item
in a hash table. This is solved by a linked list which can contain several items
chained together (Linear O(n) complexity).

## Balanced Tree

Used for indexing rows. Logarithmic O(logn) complexity. Fixed height. Faster
reading, but slower writing.

Sacrifices some space for speed compared to a linked list.

Rules:

1. Every node has at most x children.
2. Every node, except for the root and the leaves, has at least x/2 children.
3. The root node has at least two children unless it is a leaf.
4. All leaves are at the same height.
5. A non-leaf node with x children has xâˆ’1 keys.
